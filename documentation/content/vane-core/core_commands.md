Several core commands are available to ops and players in the `admin` permission group.

`/customitem`: Allows you to create custom items, as they require special NBT tags and are therefore a hassle to get right with `/give`.

`/enchant`: Enchant the item in your hand with any enchantment by minecraft or vane.

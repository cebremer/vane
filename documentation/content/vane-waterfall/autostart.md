This feature allows you to have your server automatically start when a player tries to connect to it.
This is part of vane-waterfall, a plugin for a server proxy like [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) or [Waterfall](https://docs.papermc.io/waterfall).

Check out our [Server Installer](https://oddlama.github.io/minecraft-server) for information on how set this up correctly.

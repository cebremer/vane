Opening the region menu with `/rg` and start selecting a region by clicking on **Create Region** on the left.

A region costs diamonds {{ item:minecraft:diamond }}, but when you remove the region again, you will get all your diamonds back.

## Select Region

Choose the extent of your region by selecting two opposite corners of a cube.
Use **left-** and **right-clicking** with an empty hand to set the two corners respectively.

Your region selection will be displayed live in the world.
If all requirements are met, you will see green particles together with your selection, otherwise red ones.
In that case you can reopen the region menu with `/rg` to get detailed information on what is missing.

## Create Region

To save on your server's resources, vane will shutdown your server when 20 minutes have passed
while the server is empty.
This feature is especially great combined with the [Autostart](#feature-vane-waterfall--autostart) feature by vane-waterfall,
which automatically starts your server when someone tries to connect to it.
